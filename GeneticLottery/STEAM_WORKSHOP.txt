Title: Genetic Lottery

Short Description:
Every beaver born gets a random lifespan — some live longer, some shorter. Natural variation for your colony.

Description:
[h1]Genetic Lottery[/h1]

Not all beavers are created equal. With this mod, every beaver born receives a random Life Expectancy modifier between -10% and +10%, adding natural variation to your colony's lifespans.

[h2]How It Works[/h2]
[list]
[*] Each newborn beaver gets a random Life Expectancy bonus between -10% and +10%
[*] The bonus is permanent and lasts the beaver's entire life
[*] Visible in the beaver's bonus panel alongside other modifiers
[*] Uses the game's built-in bonus system — no weird hacks
[/list]

Some beavers will be blessed with long lives. Others won't be so lucky. Plan your colony accordingly.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

[*] Timberborn v1.0.0.0+
[*] Works with all factions
[*] Safe to add to existing saves (only affects newly born beavers)
