Title: Genetic Lottery

Short Description:
Prevents death waves by giving each beaver a random lifespan. No more entire generations dying at once.

Description:
[h1]Genetic Lottery[/h1]

Tired of death waves wiping out half your colony? In vanilla Timberborn, beavers born at the same time all die at the same time, creating population waves and boom/bust cycles. This mod fixes that.

Every beaver born receives a random Life Expectancy modifier between -10% and +10%, desynchronizing lifespans across your colony so deaths happen gradually instead of all at once.

[h2]How It Works[/h2]
[list]
[*] Each newborn beaver gets a random Life Expectancy bonus between -10% and +10%
[*] Prevents death waves by spreading out lifespans
[*] Smooths population fluctuations for more stable, predictable gameplay
[*] The bonus is permanent and visible in the beaver's bonus panel
[*] Uses the game's built-in bonus system — no weird hacks
[/list]

Some beavers will be blessed with long lives. Others won't be so lucky. But your colony won't collapse overnight.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
[list]
[*] Timberborn v1.0.0.0+
[*] Works with all factions
[*] Safe to add to existing saves (only affects newly born beavers)
