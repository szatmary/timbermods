Title: Dynamite Rubble

Short Description:
Dynamite and tunnel explosions now leave behind Dirt rubble. No more free terrain removal!

Description:
[h1]Dynamite Rubble[/h1]

Explosions shouldn't just make terrain vanish into thin air. With this mod, every terrain block destroyed by dynamite or tunnel construction leaves behind recoverable Dirt.

[h2]How It Works[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Dynamite[/b] produces 3 Dirt per terrain block actually destroyed
[*] [b]Tunnels[/b] produce 3 Dirt when construction finishes
[*] Triple dynamite on solid ground? 9 Dirt. On a 1-block overhang? Just 3.
[*] The mod counts actual terrain removed — overhangs and thin columns are handled correctly
[/list]

Dirt appears as a recoverable good stack at the explosion site, just like when you demolish a building.

[h2]Examples[/h2]
[list]
[*] Single dynamite on solid ground: 3 Dirt
[*] Double dynamite on solid ground: 6 Dirt
[*] Triple dynamite on solid ground: 9 Dirt
[*] Triple dynamite on a 2-block overhang: 6 Dirt
[*] Any dynamite on a 1-block overhang: 3 Dirt
[*] Tunnel: 3 Dirt
