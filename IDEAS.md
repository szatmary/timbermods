# Mod Ideas

## Distribution Station
Large building that stores a small amount of everything (around 100 units each). Acts as a central hub for distributing goods to nearby buildings, reducing hauling distances.

## Wine
Full production chain mod:
- **Grape Vines** — new crop/plant that beavers tend
- **Wine Press** — building to crush grapes into wine
- **Wine Storage** — barrels or cellar building
- **Effects:**
  - Very high happiness bonus for beavers who consume it
  - Reduces worker efficiency (tipsy beavers)
  - Bots can use wine as fuel

## Lifespan Randomizer
Randomly add +/- days to beaver lifespan to reduce synchronized waves of births and deaths. Would likely need Harmony to patch the aging/lifespan system. Feasibility depends on whether lifespan is a single fixed value or configurable per-beaver.
